# Flutter 运行报错

## 报错内容: `The argument type 'Widget?' can't be assigned to the parameter type 'Widget'.`

```log
RenderBox was not laid out: RenderRepaintBoundary#c04ed relayoutBoundary=up2 NEEDS-LAYOUT NEEDS-PAINT
'package:flutter/src/rendering/box.dart':
Failed assertion: line 1929 pos 12: 'hasSize'
```

原因分析: 垂直方向上给了一个无限大的高度,这个是因为子Widget是ListView,flutter中ListView在构建控件时会“询问”子组件所要求的空间,而ListView无法给出具体值,像Column ListView这些Widget它如果没有专门设置对应的属性,那么它默认的情况就是会尽可能多的占据空间对于父Widget如果是一个需要知道子Widget的高度的情况就会无法计算排布,父Widget就会不知道怎么排布而报错
比如一个Container套一个ListView这样就会报错
或者是一个ListView套一个ListView。
解决办法: 将ListView放入一个能确定高度的Widget中。 you can try wrapping inside Expanded or Flexible widgets.

### 报错内: `Failed assertion: line 1929 pos 12: 'hasSize'`

原因分析:
  1.可能时 SDK 版本问题, 需要修改配置文件的 SDK 版本
  2.Widget 的值不能为 null, 需要通过 `child!` 的形式将 `child` 转化为 `Widget`

解决办法:
You would have updated the dart SDK version and hence null safety is included in your project.
It's pretty simple to solve just go to your pubspec.yaml file and under environment variable, you will find the dart SDK range which should be something like this sdk: ">=2.12.0 <3.0.0".

This effectively caches VeryExpensiveWidget, building it once and then using that for all future calls to the builder.
The problem is that you may not pass a child in. In the first example, we don't need the child parameter, and this is totally fine. However, it means that child is now null. Because this is allowed behavior, child must be a Widget?
In your case, you always pass in a child parameter, so you can guarantee that the child passed into builder is non-null, so it is safe to use child! to forcibly convert child into a Widget.
